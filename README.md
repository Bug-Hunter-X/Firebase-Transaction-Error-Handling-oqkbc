# Firebase Transaction Error Handling
This example demonstrates a common error in Firebase transactions and how to handle it properly.
The original code lacks robust error handling, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly in case of a failed transaction.
The improved solution addresses this by implementing comprehensive error handling to catch and report exceptions during the transaction process.
